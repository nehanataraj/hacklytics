You are building Part 1: a localhost NPC Studio web app (Next.js App Router).
Keep it simple: file-based storage in data/npcs.json (no database yet).
Use TypeScript, Zod validation, and minimal dependencies.
UI: Tailwind only (no component libraries unless asked).
Create pages: / (list), /npc/new, /npc/[id].
Create API routes: /api/npcs (GET/POST), /api/npcs/[id] (GET/PUT/DELETE).
Do not add auth. Do not add deployment.
All secrets must come from process.env; never hardcode keys.
Prefer readable code over abstraction; avoid over-engineering.
